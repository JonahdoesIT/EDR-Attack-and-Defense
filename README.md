# EDR-Attack-and-Defense
This lab project is focused on simulating a realistic cyber attack and evaluating endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities. Following Eric Capuano’s online guide, I’ve set up virtual machines to represent both attacker and victim environments. The attacker machine uses the Sliver C2 framework to carry out the attack, while the target Windows endpoint is monitored using LimaCharlie as the EDR solution.
